# Terraform Docker Jenkins Module
## Introduction
This module provides a local Jenkins server using Docker.

## URL
If you're using a *NIX system, you may choose to edit `/etc/hosts` to access Jenkins with a pretty URL.
```bash
# You may have to use sudo if you're running with your local user
echo "127.0.0.1\tjenkins.local" >> /etc/hosts
```
